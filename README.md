# GIF-project2
GIF Library is for users to save gifs for easy access and future use instead of having to comb and look through their bookmarks.

## Features
* Filter/search function for faster access
* Users can add tags for easier recall of gifs

## Unsolved Problems
* Users don't have their own collection of gifs
* Users signing up/logging have no connection to management of their collection of gifs
* Filter/search is case sensitive
* Tags don't open a new collection of gifs relating to specified tag
## Credits
James Reichard for helping with filter/search function.  Filter/search looks for ```data-tags="{{this.tags}}"```
